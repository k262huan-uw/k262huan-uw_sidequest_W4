## Description

Based on example 3, creates and positions the player using preloads and loadJSON files. Multiple levels of a maze game.

---

## Learning Goals

Learning Goals:

- Loads JSON levels (preload)
- Builds Level objects
- Creates/positions the Player
- Handles input + level switching

It is intentionally light on "details" because those are moved into:

- Level.js (grid + drawing + tile meaning)
- Player.js (position + movement rules)

## Assets

N/A

## GenAI

The code was written by Dr. Karen Cochrane and David Han but they used GenAI to write the comments.

No GenAI used for creating level 3 & 4 by Katrina Huang.
